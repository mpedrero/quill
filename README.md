Quill - A (very) simple blog engine
===================================

Quill is an extremely simple blog engine designed and written by someone that 
has not got any idea of web programming :) 

**Planned features** include:

* **Static HTML pages**, none dynamic pages
* Entries written in **Markdown** (and possibly others similar languages in the
  future)
* Customizable theme via **CSS** (KISS :P)
* Configuration via single file
* **RSS/Atom**

**Future development** include:

* **Comments** (via Disqus or custom)
* Social integration

In terms of webserver, I'm still thinking if I should go to Apache, Lighttpd,
etc. or custom webserver (web.py?)
